The Quick Play mode also features a fifth location option- "Random" in case you're into surprises or you're feeling lucky.

The game also features a (not-so-)hidden treasure chest within every maze.
How To Play 🎮
Enter F, R, L, B or X (in uppercase) within the game to navigate Forward, Right, Left, go Back or Exit the maze, respectively.

A bird-eye view of the maze is displayed on the screen for the user. It serves as a satellite image (top elevation) of the maze and it is used for navigation within the maze.

Note: The satellite image does not display the appearance of the maze from what seems to be the Point-Of-View of the player, it is simply a zoom-out of the maze structure
